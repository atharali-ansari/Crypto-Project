# File Encryption/Decryption Web Application

This project is a web-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files securely using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption. The application is built using Flask for the backend, with a simple and intuitive frontend interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Users can upload a file and encrypt it with a key of their choice.
- **File Decryption**: Encrypted files can be decrypted using the same key that was used for encryption.
- **AES Encryption**: The application uses AES encryption in CBC mode to ensure data security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The frontend is designed to be simple, responsive, and visually appealing, with a background image and dynamic feedback.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
